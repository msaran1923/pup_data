"Open-ended question responses (Drawing from your personal experience in the IT industry, describe the primary reasons you have observed for IT project failures. Can you provide specific examples or insights that illustrate these factors?)"
"I think business analysis and capturing business requirements are key to project success. Stakeholder management is another important component that is not addressed here. Moreover, the pace of the project is important- doing tasks too quickly results in failure as well. So, the way the project is implemented, whether agile or linear, is also key to its success. Applying project management principles in a structured way would also avoid failures. Good luck."

"Ambiguous scope boundaries,  Scope creep, Overdoing agile (orthodox agile) and less result focus,  Lack of support and ownership from top management,  Team immaturity in terms of functioning as a team and technical aspect, Lack of “structure” and governance,  Inability to manage and steer the customer, Unrealistic targets and overpromising, Belated projects are becoming obsolete anymore "
"The failure to clarify customer expectations, analysis, and scope; inadequate planning, analysis, and design; not managing ongoing changes after the project has started with change management; not establishing a sufficiently competent and experienced team; and proceeding with inadequate, weak solutions found on the internet due to a cost-focused approach are the main failure factors."
"Prolonged life cycles - hence changing key resources, changing business needs, changes in scope, elimination of important key features, oversight of relevant factors"

"Project sponsors and adaptation by customers are one of the most important parts of any project. It is not always about completing a project. How it is perceived by end users, supported by other teams, and communicated within the organization makes a huge difference in the lifecycle and success of a project."
Lack of requirements. Poor requirements analysis. Insufficient verification and validation activities.

"I've mostly been involved in projects for embedded software and, to a lesser extent also, hardware. It is surprising to see how hardware development (in my experience) seems to be so much better predictable than software development. I'm not sure why that is. Is it better understood, perhaps? Regarding question 15, I think it is not necessary for an IT project manager to be knowledgeable about the details, but it does help."
"The scope of work is not clearly defined. Bad-managed analysis and design phase
Misalignment between expectations and delivery capabilities combined with poor knowledge or understanding of required equipment and human resources needed to deliver successfully"

"At the beginning of the project, there was a failure to clearly define requirements, project stakeholders, and the responsibilities of stakeholders. Trying to run the project with personnel who do not have sufficient knowledge."
"Projects are mostly done in the public sector just for the sake of work, while in the private sector, they are carried out with increasing and changing expectations.

Project sponsors do not give enough importance to the project and avoid motivating the project team sufficiently.

"There is no direct relationship between doing the work and making the payment for public projects. Political connections are influential. In private sector projects, the project owner is generally not knowledgeable and prefers to buy products instead of consulting services."
"The most important factor affecting the failures in IT projects is the perception that these projects are seen as automation tasks. The IT project team often approaches and works on the project in this way. However, one of the most important goals of a good IT project should be to advance conventional working structures. IT projects that save computers from simply counting data and make them capable of data analysis make a difference."

Customer Budget Problem
The inability to establish a balance between scope and time.
"Unfortunately, there are problems wherever there are people. Especially in a sector like IT, despite the need for high amounts of money, management trying to cut the necessary fees (including the number of personnel) is really annoying. In addition, extra and unpaid overtime, and even just saying ""good job"" as a motivation, like charity. Unfortunately, there are those who even find this too much."
"The lack of involvement or insufficiency of field experts in the project team leads to communication and expectation issues between the project owner and implementers.

"The inability to achieve a healthy combination of people, processes, and technology in IT projects and many other projects leads to project failures. The right people with the required competencies should be selected for the project. Those who know the technology may not fully understand the process. Or those who understand the process may not use the right technology. Achieving this harmony greatly contributes to the successful completion and continuity of projects. Good luck.. good work."
Stakeholders not owning or believing in the project.

"There should be harmony between all the project components in their respective areas of responsibility. The project manager's ability to see these details and the future and to continually compare them with the documented expectations of the customer is key to the project's success.

"Product ownership (product owner) should exist on both the IT and business unit sides. Requirements should be clear and tracked item by item (RTM-requirement trace matrix). The project plan should be prepared with every detail considered. The project organization must be established, and all parties must be informed and approved. The project's schedule, organization, and organizational responsibility matrix (RACI) should be created, etc. The project should start with a kick-off meeting involving all stakeholders. Each stage of the project should be reported and have approval processes, such as analysis report approval, design approval, etc. Issues and risks should not be overlooked and should be managed well. The project team should consist of competent personnel from the business and IT sides. The project status should be monitored through routine weekly meetings, and risks and issues should be escalated."

"Starting on a large scale. Instead of progressing piece by piece, wanting to complete and deliver the whole project at once. Lack of know-how and experience. Not knowing what is happening in the world regarding such projects. Changes in the teams that start the projects. Changes in the authority that owns the project. The project not receiving sufficient support within the institution, even facing sabotage by staff resistant to change. Stakeholders are voicing their concerns not during the project's development stages but after completion, etc. I have been managing projects for 12 years. I have received two awards, both ETR and TBV. When a project starts, I can now see whether it will explode or fly."

d. Lack of project coordination (between project sponsor, project manager, technical manager, and development teams).
e. Lack or incompetence in project management experience (the least common reason).
In order of most to least encountered reasons: a-most common, e-least common."
IT projects should be long-term projects that start with properly analyzing goals and objectives. Getting good results from IT projects that have been hastily concluded without a thorough feasibility analysis is impossible.
